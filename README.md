# **Road Accident Dashboard â€“ Project Summary**

This dashboard provides a **comprehensive overview of road accident casualties**, segmented by severity, vehicle type, road type, surface conditions, light conditions, and location. It helps stakeholders identify high-risk areas and prioritize road safety measures.

---

## **1. High-Level KPIs**

* **Total Casualties:** **417,883**
* **Fatal Casualties:** **7,135 (1.7%)**
* **Serious Casualties:** **59,312 (14.2%)**
* **Slight Casualties:** **351,436 (84.1%)**
* **Casualties by Cars:** **333,485 (79.8% of total)**

ðŸ‘‰ The majority of casualties are **slight** but still represent a significant burden on healthcare and road safety resources.

---

## **2. Casualties by Vehicle Type**

* **Cars:** 333,485 (dominant cause, \~80%)
* **Goods Vehicles (Trucks):** 33,472
* **Bicycles:** 33,672
* **Buses:** 12,798
* **Motorcycles:** 3,424
* **Other Vehicles (Agricultural, Special):** 1,032

ðŸ‘‰ Cars are the **primary contributor**, but **bicycles and goods vehicles** also show notable shares, reflecting risks for both motorized and non-motorized transport.

---

## **3. Casualties by Road Type**

* **Single Carriageway:** 309.7k (majority)
* **Dual Carriageway:** 67.4k
* **Roundabout:** 26.8k
* **Other Road Types (One-way, Slip Roads):** <10k each

ðŸ‘‰ **Single carriageways are the highest-risk road type**, indicating infrastructure and speed management challenges.

---

## **4. Casualties by Road Surface**

* **Dry Roads:** Majority of accidents
* **Wet Roads:** Significant portion
* **Snow/Ice:** Minor but critical during winters

ðŸ‘‰ Most accidents occur on **dry surfaces**, indicating driver behavior and road design are bigger factors than just weather.

---

## **5. Casualties by Light Condition**

* **Daylight:** 305k
* **Darkness:** 112.9k

ðŸ‘‰ Majority of accidents happen in **daylight**, reflecting high traffic exposure. But night-time accidents, though fewer, may have **higher severity**.

---

## **6. Casualties by Location**

* **Urban Areas:** 255.9k
* **Rural Areas:** 162k

ðŸ‘‰ Urban roads experience **more accidents** due to higher vehicle density, but **rural accidents may be more severe** due to higher speeds and delayed emergency response.

---

## **7. Monthly Trend (2021 vs 2022)**

* Accident trends remain **consistent across months**.
* Peaks visible in **summer and late year**, likely due to higher mobility during holidays and travel seasons.

# **Key Insights**

1. **Cars are the dominant contributor (80%)** â†’ strong need for car-specific safety interventions.
2. **Single carriageways are the deadliest road type** â†’ require better design, signage, and enforcement.
3. **Urban accidents are more frequent, rural accidents more severe** â†’ different strategies required for each.
4. **Dry road accidents dominate** â†’ weather is not the main driver, **driver behavior & infrastructure** are key factors.
5. **Daylight accidents are more frequent** â†’ high exposure due to peak traffic volumes.

---

# **Recommendations**

1. **Infrastructure Improvements**

   * Upgrade **single carriageways** with dividers, rumble strips, and better lane markings.
   * Enhance **pedestrian and cyclist safety measures** in urban areas.

2. **Driver Awareness & Enforcement**

   * Strict **speed control** on both urban and rural roads.
   * **Awareness campaigns** focusing on distracted driving and seatbelt use.

3. **Vehicle Safety Enhancements**

   * Encourage **advanced safety features (ADAS, ABS, airbags)** in cars.
   * Mandate **regular vehicle fitness checks** for trucks and buses.

4. **Targeted Road Safety Campaigns**

   * Promote **helmet and protective gear use** for two-wheeler riders.
   * Run **city-level safety programs** for cyclists and pedestrians.

5. **Emergency Response**

   * Improve **ambulance response times** in rural areas.
   * Invest in **AI-based accident detection & reporting systems**.
